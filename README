# Pybtex

Pybtex reads citation information from a file and
produces a formatted bibliography. BibTeX style files are supported.
Alternatively it is possible to write styles in Python.

Pybtex currently understands the following bibliography formats:

- BibTeX
- BibTeXML
- YAML-based format

The resulting bibliography may be output in one of the following formats
(not supported by legacy BibTeX styles):

- LaTeX
- HTML
- plain text

## From the original website:

Pybtex is a drop-in replacement for BibTeX written in Python. You can start using it right now by simply typing pybtex where you would have typed bibtex.

### FAQ:

- Is it really BibTeX-compatible?
  - Yes, it really is, most of the time. BibTeX styles work fine with Pybtex, although there are still some minor issues. Nevertheless, we are going to achieve 100% compatibility before releasing version 1.0. If something does not work for you, just let us know.
- But why should I use it instead of BibTeX?
  - You probably should not if you ask. But still, Pybtex has Unicode inside. It supports BibTeXML and YAML. It can write HTML and plain text. It is extensible and fun to hack. It comes with a free database conversion utility. And designing new bibliography styles is no more a pain with Pybtex' brand new pythonic style API. See the feature overview for more details.

## `bibtex` replacement usage:

    latex foo.tex
    pybtex foo.aux
    latex foo.tex
    latex foo.tex
